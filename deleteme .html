\section{Introduction}
In recent years, technical advances and improvements
in cardiac computed tomography (CT) and cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provoked increasing
interest in the potential clinical role of these techniques
in the non-invasive work-up of patients with suspected
coronary artery disease (CAD) and correct patient selection
for these emerging imaging techniques. In the primary
detection or exclusion of significant CAD, e.g. in the
patient with unspecific thoracic complaints, and also in
patients with known CAD or advanced stages of CAD, both
CT and MRI yield specific advantages. In this review, the
major aspects of non-invasive MR and CT imaging in the
diagnosis of CAD will be discussed. The first part describes
the clinical value of contrast-enhanced non-invasive CT
coronary angiography (CTCA), including the diagnostic
accuracy of CTCA for the exclusion or detection of
significant CAD with coronary artery stenoses that may

After study from some other research papers in introductory part we can use  this MRI and CT machine in coronary artery disease

Most established non-invasive diagnostic techniques in
the primary diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected
CAD, such as stress electrocardiography (ECG), stress
echocardiography or scintigraphy [single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission
tomography (PET)] are aimed at the detection of a reduced
coronary perfusion reserve, i.e. detection of reduced
myocardial perfusion or regional wall motion abnormalities
under stress conditions. In recent years, MRI and CT have
also increasingly been used in the primary diagnostic workup
of CAD.

\section{how this relate with nuclear medicine }

For these indications, CT and MRI
applications available are:
1. Coronary calcification scoring (or coronary vessel wall
imaging in general) by CT
2. Non-invasive coronary angiography by MRI or CT
3. Stress cine MRI and stress perfusion MRI
4. Myocardial viability imaging using MRI or CT
Recently, the first results of stress perfusion CT have
also been published. Many of these imaging methods have
been reported to yield a high negative predictive value, i.e.
a normal result of these tests rules out a haemo dynamically
significant CAD with a high probability. For a reasonable
implication of imaging strategies in clinical practice,
however, the pre-test probability must be considered to
avoid needless examinations

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues within your body. Most MRI machines are large, tube-shaped magnets. When you lie inside an MRI machine, the magnetic field temporarily realigns hydrogen atoms in your body. The addition of our 3T MRI has brought patient care to an entirely new level. MRI Services is located at Kootenai Health in the Heart Center.
